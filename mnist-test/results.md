# Results; Comparing my `nn` Class and `torch.nn`

Here we analyze we compare the class we build with a `torch` neural network. I do this to analyze if it has a similar behaviour or it has poorly results. Depending on the results I'll decide on scale this project to a VAE, modify this repo, or build the VAE with torch. 

We compare the models in three cases:

1. Using basic grad descendent optimitzation. 
2. Powring backpropagation with ADAM.
3. Using Stochastic Gradient Descendent (SGD).
